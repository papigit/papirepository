Full Stack Application
Introduction
You will need to write code to build a new full stack application which has front-end, back-end and a database.

Tools
Use Java/Python/Other programming language of your choice
Use Spring Boot/Django/Other frameworks for building the REST service
Use React/Angular/Other frameworks for building the front end
Use equivalent unit tests frameworks where required
Use any database of choice like PostgreSQL/MySQL/others 
Use github/gitlab for source code repository and pipelines

Requirements
Build a simple customer REST Service supporting CRUD operations using a database. The customer records should be stored on the database.
                GET - List all the customers
                PUT - Update an existing customer record
                POST - Create a new customer record
                DELETE - Delete a existing customer record

Build a simple user interface for supporting the CRUD operations on the REST service

JSON Structure For Customer
{"first-name":"Tom", 
 "middle-name":"",
"last-name":"Hanks",
"date-of-birth":"10-May-1978",
"mobile-number":"+65 84321111",
"gender":"M",
"customer-number":"AU10042001",
"country-of-birth":"US",
"country-of-residence":"SG",
"customer-segment":"Retail",
"addresses":[
   {
     "type":"Residence",
     "addr-line1":"Pickering Street",
     "addr-line2":"#10-231",
     "addr-line3":"",
     "addr-line4":"",
     "country-code":"SG",
     "zipcode":"512161",
     "state":"",
     "city":"Singapore"
   },
   {
     "type":"Office",
     "addr-line1":"Changi Business Park",
     "addr-line2":"#04-31",
     "addr-line3":"",
     "addr-line4":"",
     "country-code":"SG",
     "zipcode":"409768",
     "state":"",
     "city":"Singapore"
   }
   ]
}

Infrastructure as Code on Cloud Platform

Introduction
You will need to write code to provision an infrastructure in any cloud provider of your choice for a web application hosting. The web application follows the reference architecture of AWS https://media.amazonwebservices.com/architecturecenter/AWS_ac_ra_web_01.pdf 

Tools
Use terraform/cloud formation/equivalent for creating infrastructure using code
Use Ansible/Chef/Puppet/others for 
                a) Platform deployments like nginx, tomcat or others
                b) Application components like static content, spring boot microservices etc.
Use github/gitlab for source code repository and pipelines

Requirements
Build a new environment in cloud using the reference architecture and run via Jenkins pipeline. 
Use the REST application built in the previous exercise to deploy them on the Application Servers
Use the static content created in the previous exercise to deploy on the Web Servers
Use an RDS/equivalent service as the database
Please setup autoscaling for both Web & App Server layers to increase/decrease capacity based on the demand
Use ELB's for both Web & App Server layers
Enable Multi-AZ for the RDS/equivalent database
Cloud Front shown in the architecture is optional - add only if you have time.
